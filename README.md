# rubiks-cube

## Introduction

_Project for the Intelligent Systems' subject, at Escuela Superior de Informatica in the UCLM University_.

This project consists on solving a rubik's cube applying searching algorithms and strategies.

## System requirements

In order to be able to execute the program you should have installed on your computer _Python3_.

The same thing applies to the following packages:
1. numpy
2. sortedcontainers



### How to install _Python3_

Installing _Python3_ in Ubuntu it's an easy task:
... `$ sudo apt-get update`
... `$ sudo apt-get install python3.6`


### How to install packages

..* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
... `$ sudo pip install numpy `

..* [sortedcontainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/)
... `$ sudo pip install numpy`

## Executing the program

Now we are going to execute the program.
To do that we have to be either in the project folder (_rubiks-cube_) or the source code folder (_rubiks-cube/src_).

In both cases we are going to execute the _Main.py_ file that is in the *src* folder.

For the first one the execution will be as follows:
... `$ python3 ./src/Main.py`

For the second option, will be like this:
... `$ python3 Main.py`

*Any other way of executing the program could lead to problems in the project resources management.*
